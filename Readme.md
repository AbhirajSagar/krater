# 🎮 Generic Multiplayer Game Backend (Node.js)

A high-performance, agnostic WebSocket & REST multiplayer backend for Node.js. It features **client-controlled data sharing**, **public and private lobby management**, **shareable room codes**, **reconnection grace periods**, and a **built-in interactive visual test client**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Game-Agnostic & Client-Controlled**: The server does not enforce game rules. Clients freely control and broadcast their own data, actions, and state slices.
- **Lobby & Room Management**:
  - **Shareable Room Codes**: Clean, human-friendly 6-character room codes (e.g. `K7X9PQ`) generated without confusing characters (0/O, 1/I, L).
  - **Public & Private Lobbies**: Private lobbies are hidden from discovery and joinable only by code or link.
  - **Password Protection**: Optional passwords for private matches.
  - **Deep Linking**: Shareable join links (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/?join=K7X9PQ`) that auto-fill room codes.
  - **Configurable Player Limits**: Set max players per lobby (e.g., 2 for chess, 4 for cards, 16+ for battle royales).
  - **Spectator Mode**: Allow players to spectate without occupying player slots.
  - **Host Controls & Migration**: Start game, lock/unlock lobby, kick players, and automatic host migration when the host leaves.
- **Multi-Mode Client Data Sharing**:
  - **Broadcast to Others (`target: 'others'`)**: Default relay to all other players in the room.
  - **Broadcast to All (`target: 'all'`)**: Relays to everyone including the sender.
  - **Targeted Whisper (`target: '<playerId>'`)**: Direct P2P messaging, private deals, or WebRTC signaling.
  - **Host Message (`target: 'host'`)**: Send events exclusively to the lobby host.
- **Client-Controlled State Synchronization**:
  - **Shared Room State**: Key-value state store patched by clients and synchronized to all members.
  - **Player State**: Each player manages their own state slice (position, HP, inventory, etc.).
  - **Automatic Catch-Up**: New players and reconnected players automatically receive current room and player state snapshots upon joining.
- **Session Reconnection Grace Period**:
  - Secret `reconnectToken` issued to each player.
  - If a connection drops (network glitch, page refresh), players have a configurable grace period (default 30s) to resume their session without losing their slot.
- **Universal Client SDK**:
  - Zero-dependency client SDK that runs in web browsers, Node.js, and game engines (Phaser, Three.js, Pixi, Godot, Unity WebGL, etc.).
- **Built-in Interactive Web Test Client**:
  - Real-time dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to test multiple clients, lobbies, chat, state syncing, and reconnection.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
# Production start
npm start

# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port `3000`:
- **Web Test Client & Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `ws://localhost:3000/ws`
- **Health Check**: [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health)
- **Public Rooms API**: [http://localhost:3000/api/rooms](http://localhost:3000/api/rooms)

### 3. Run Automated Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## 💻 Client SDK Integration

The client SDK is available in `src/sdk/client.js` (ESM) and statically served at `/sdk/client.js` or `/client-sdk.js`.

### Browser / Frontend Integration (HTML / React / Vue / Phaser)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { MultiplayerClient } from '/client-sdk.js';

  const client = new MultiplayerClient();
  await client.connect();

  // Create a room
  const { room, player } = await client.createRoom({
    name: 'Arena 1',
    gameType: 'tictactoe',
    isPrivate: false,
    maxPlayers: 2,
    player: { name: 'Alice' },
    initialState: { board: [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null] },
  });

  console.log(`Room Code: ${room.code}`);

  // Listen for relayed events from other players
  client.on('relay:PLAYER_MOVE', (data, senderId) => {
    console.log(`Player ${senderId} placed move at index ${data.index}`);
  });

  // Listen for shared room state updates
  client.on('roomStateUpdated', ({ state, patch }) => {
    console.log('Updated room board:', state.board);
  });
</script>
```

### Joining a Room by Code

```javascript
const client = new MultiplayerClient();
await client.connect();

const { room, player } = await client.joinRoom({
  roomCode: 'K7X9PQ',
  player: { name: 'Bob' },
});

// Broadcast action to other players
client.relay('PLAYER_MOVE', { index: 4, mark: 'O' });

// Patch shared room state
await client.updateRoomState({
  board: ['X', null, null, null, 'O', null, null, null, null],
  turn: 'Alice',
});
```

### Direct Whispers / P2P WebRTC Signaling

```javascript
// Whisper to a specific player ID
client.relay('SECRET_CARD', { card: 'Ace of Hearts' }, targetPlayerId);

// WebRTC Signaling offer/answer relay
client.relay('WEBRTC_OFFER', { sdp: peerOfferSdp }, peerPlayerId);
```

## 📡 WebSocket Protocol Reference

All WebSocket messages follow a standardized JSON envelope:
